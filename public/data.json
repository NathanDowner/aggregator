Some even claimed it to be a simple case of confirmation bias. Some = Jon Prosser.\n\n\n#jellygate on the new iPad mini…what's up with this screen? pic.twitter.com/FaKFxCasQg\n— Sam Kohl (@iupdate) September 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few people with a following point it out, and *now* everyone “notices” it. \nI think it’s a simple case of confirmation bias.\n— Jon Prosser (@jon_prosser) September 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, “jelly scrolling” is referring to screen tearing which can make images or text on one side of the screen appear to be tilted at a downward angle because of incongruity in refresh rates. In other words, one side of the screen looks as if it’s responding faster than the other side, which creates this sort of visual disturbance that is “jelly scrolling.”\nToday, Apple reported to Ars Technica that jelly scrolling is normal behavior for an LCD screen.\n“Update, 9/28/2021: In response to our inquiry, Apple has told us that the “jelly scroll” issue on the 6th-generation iPad mini is normal behavior for LCD screens. Because these screens do refresh line by line, there is a tiny delay between when the lines at the top of the screen and lines at the bottom are refreshed. This can cause uneven scrolling issues like the ones observed on the iPad.”\n– Ars Technica\nApple explains that because these screens refresh line by line, it causes a smol delay when the lines at the top of the screen and the bottom of the screen are refreshed. The result? #jellygate, apparently.\nWhile many Twitter users pointed out that jelly scrolling can be seen on other devices, some insist it’s much more pronounced on the iPad mini 6 than any other LCD screen device like the iPad Air or iPad 9.\n\n\nregarding the “jelly effect” when scrolling on iPad mini: \nyep. typical LCD / 60Hz behavior\nhappens on the iPad Air too, but that didn’t make the news  pic.twitter.com/V5wJq5SnJx\n— Jon Prosser (@jon_prosser) September 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is is slow-mo video of scrolling on the iPad Min i slowed down EVEN MORE in a frame-by-frame step through. Notice how the right moves up faster than the left.\nIn normal usage you barely see it, but every now and then it become noticeable. In landscape it goes away entirely pic.twitter.com/iq9LGJzsDI\n— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) September 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does Apple calling “jelly scrolling” ‘normal behavior’ mean? Unfortunately for everyone, it means that all those unhappy with what they’re seeing will not be eligible for a replacement device from Apple.\nAnd if you are one of those people who won’t be able to get past #jellygate, be sure to return within Apple’s standard return period of 14 days after purchase. Who knows, Apple could possibly issue some sort of software fix in the future, but, don’t hold your breath.\nThe post Apple Responds to Controversial ‘Jelly Scrolling’ on iPad mini 6, Says it’s ‘Normal’ appeared first on FrontPageTech.com.",

That&#8217;s right, no iPhone mini in 2022. Instead, expect two 6.1-inch devices and two 6.7-inch devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lineup will look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>iPhone 14 &#8211; 6.1&#8243;</li><li>iPhone 14 &#8216;Max?&#8217; &#8211; 6.7&#8243;</li><li>iPhone 14 Pro &#8211; 6.1&#8243;</li><li>iPhone 14 Pro Max &#8211; 6.7&#8243;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman&#8217;s report comes just a week after Apple officially shipped iPhone 13 models to customers, so if these iPhone 14 rumors seem early, it&#8217;s because they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also worth mentioning is that Mark actually name drops &#8220;iPhone 14&#8221; in his newsletter. For context, he never referred to this year&#8217;s iPhone as &#8220;iPhone 13&#8221; until we were literally 2 days away from the September Event. Mark is typically very careful about how he refers to devices, so seeing him actually call the 2022 iPhone &#8220;iPhone 14&#8221; is rather interesting to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this is not the first time you&#8217;re hearing of a &#8220;complete redesign&#8221; for iPhone 14. <a href=\"https://www.frontpagetech.com/2021/09/08/exclusive-a-closer-first-look-at-iphone-14/\">We shared full renders</a> of next year&#8217;s design overhaul earlier this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We shared what we&#8217;ve seen of the design just a week before Apple&#8217;s iPhone 13 event, even causing &#8220;iPhone 14&#8221; to trend as high as #2 on Twitter that day.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"675\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://www.frontpagetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/trending.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10140\" srcset=\"https://www.frontpagetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/trending.jpg 675w, https://www.frontpagetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/trending-300x163.jpg 300w, https://www.frontpagetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/trending-610x332.jpg 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" /><figcaption>Our iPhone 14 leak trending on Twitter &#8211; September 8, 2021</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In his newsletter, Mark Gurman didn&#8217;t go into any further detail about what he expects for the redesign, but it does line up with our reporting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the front of the device, at least for the iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple plans on finally getting rid of the notch in favor of a hole-punch, with Face ID working under the display.

That’s right, no iPhone mini in 2022. Instead, expect two 6.1-inch devices and two 6.7-inch devices.\nThe lineup will look like this:\niPhone 14 – 6.1″\niPhone 14 ‘Max?’ – 6.7″\niPhone 14 Pro – 6.1″\niPhone 14 Pro Max – 6.7″\n\n\n\n\nGurman’s report comes just a week after Apple officially shipped iPhone 13 models to customers, so if these iPhone 14 rumors seem early, it’s because they are.\nAlso worth mentioning is that Mark actually name drops “iPhone 14” in his newsletter. For context, he never referred to this year’s iPhone as “iPhone 13” until we were literally 2 days away from the September Event. Mark is typically very careful about how he refers to devices, so seeing him actually call the 2022 iPhone “iPhone 14” is rather interesting to me.\nOf course, this is not the first time you’re hearing of a “complete redesign” for iPhone 14. We shared full renders of next year’s design overhaul earlier this month.\nWe shared what we’ve seen of the design just a week before Apple’s iPhone 13 event, even causing “iPhone 14” to trend as high as #2 on Twitter that day.\nOur iPhone 14 leak trending on Twitter – September 8, 2021\nIn his newsletter, Mark Gurman didn’t go into any further detail about what he expects for the redesign, but it does line up with our reporting. \nOn the front of the device, at least for the iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple plans on finally getting rid of the notch in favor of a hole-punch, with Face ID working under the display. This was also reiterated and corroborated just last week by Ming-Chi Kuo.\n\n\n\n\nOn the back, we’re expecting Apple’s Ceramic Shield glass — glossy, instead of the usual matte finish — with minimal to no camera bump. Titanium sides will surround the device for a more premium, modern take on the classic iPhone 4 design. \n\n\n\n\nWe should see more iPhone 14 details leak out as we get closer to a release, but with a whole year away, it’s safe to just temper expectations and enjoy iPhone 13 season while it’s hot.\nThat 14 does look pretty good doe \nThe post iPhone 14 Coming With “Complete Redesign” Next Year, Says Mark Gurman appeared first on FrontPageTech.com.",
